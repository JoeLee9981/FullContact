Designed in C# using XAML - FullContact++

  This project was created as a class project. The idea was to redesign an order management system we used at work.
  The system used is sparse, and ugly. The order information was entered was out of order and inconvenient, causing
  users to skip around in the system costing time, which costs money and looks bad for clients. This system was 
  redesigned to streamline the whole process and fix the issues.

  *It is important to note that this was designed with Microsoft SQL Server, the databases used are local, in order to
   run this program on a local computer, a Microsoft SQL Server would need to be created, then run all 3 imports from
   the file menu at the top to import .csv files included into the database.

  Features Included:
  -Zip code look up
  -Databinding to correct format issues
  -Ability to pull order history while in an order without exiting the current order
  -Larger text boxes
